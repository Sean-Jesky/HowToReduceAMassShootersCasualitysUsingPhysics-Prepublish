# HowToStopMassShootersFromBeingMassShooters
creating various hallways as a snaking hallway instead of linear hallways.


[TODO:] write a simple write up on how and why this is achevied by using hallways as snaking instead of as they are

as a shooter moves through the 'system' particles moving are constantly changing their angle of travel meaning each time the looser pulls up to shoot, the person  would be moved no to a new location, that is now out of sight of the shooter if they follow along the path, each time the shooter pulls up, the person has already moved, requireing them to move their stance each time they engage, removing a killbox and fatal funnels from the enviroment of hallways.

(its hard to explain but its a propterty of partical dynamics - specifically fluid dynamics which is why this would work to reduce deaths and woundings)


doesnt solve all problems nor all cases, but starts in this one situation of a shooter within a hallway shooting at random.

# HowToStopMassShootersFromBeingMassShooters
creating various hallways as a snaking hallway instead of linear hallways.


[TODO:] write a simple write up on how and why this is achevied by using hallways as snaking instead of as they are

as a shooter moves through the 'system' particles moving are constantly changing their angle of travel meaning each time the looser pulls up to shoot, the person  would be moved no to a new location, that is now out of seight of the shooter, each time the shooter pulls up, the person has already moved. (its hard to explain but its a propterty of partical dynamics - specifically fluid dynamics which is why this would work to reduce deaths and woundings)


doesnt solve all problems nor all cases, but starts in this one situation of a shooter within a hallway shooting at random.

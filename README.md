# HowToStopMassShootersFromBeingMassShooters
creating various hallways as a snaking hallway instead of linear hallways.


[TODO:] write a simple write up on how and why this is achevied by using hallways as snaking instead of as they are

as a shooter moves through the 'system' particles moving are constantly changing their angle of travel meaning each time the looser pulls up to shoot, the person  would be moved no to a new location, that is now out of seight of the shooter, each time the shooter pulls up, the person has already moved.


doesnt solve all problems nor all cases, but starts in this one situation of a shooter within a hallway shooting at random.
